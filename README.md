# Hotel-Reservation-System-Backend
 
The hotel reservation system works smoothly, takes reservations, provides the opportunity for the guests to be registered in the software, make a reservation, observe the room options, get information about the social facilities within the hotel, login to their account, make a payment, create an account and all the other things that could be desired in a well-functioning hotel reservation system.

For the back-end implementation, Java and Spring Boot is used as well as the Eclipse as the IDE.
